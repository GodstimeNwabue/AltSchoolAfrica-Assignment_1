      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Godstime Nwabue, a final year Production Engineering student in my 500th level at the University of Benin, Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Currently, I'm enrolled in Frontend Engineering at the School of Engineering at AltSchoolAfrica and also pursuing Fullstack Engineering in the 300DevDays program at Top Universe. Alongside my academic pursuits, I am actively involved in various extracurricular activities, and you can find details about some of these activities on my profile at <a href="[insert link]">[insert link]</a>.</p>

    <h2>Reasons for Joining AltSchool</h2>
    <p>I was driven by a strong desire to maintain consistency and ignite a spark within myself to go beyond my usual routine. I sought to perceive things differently and overcome the basics that had previously held me back. Reflecting on myself came at the right time, coinciding with the completion of my degree in Production Engineering. Acquiring a skill that complements my production knowledge seemed essential to enhance my capabilities.</p>
